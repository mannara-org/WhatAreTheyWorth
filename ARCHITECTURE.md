This is a Single-Source-of-Truth interfaces generator where you define your data
models in classes and a CRUD interface is generated using reflection.

The project includes a custom ORM and uses SQLite as a database. This is a
learning project for strongly typed langages and Object-Oriented separation of
concerns. It is also my first programming project with a GUI and a database in a
high-level language like Java (I had only ever worked with C and DSA/Competitive
Programming at the time).

It was overall a great learning experience.

# Assumptions

- All foreign and primary keys are INTs

# Decisions

- Lazy tuple validity check to allow for in-memory object graphs constructions

## Tutorial

each model implementation `ModelClass` must:

- extend the `Table` class
- register itself:

```java
    static {
        registerModel(ModelClass.class);
    }
```

- use the `@Constraints` annotation for it's non-static fields
- you can have static fields in models but you can't add fields other than to-be database columns

- all fields must be private
- impelement getters and setters for each field (to implement business logic details)

- implement the static methods
    - `isSearchable()`
    - `search()`
    - `search(String attName, Object value)`
    - `search(String boundedAttributeName, Object lowerBound, Object upperBound)`
    - `searchRanges(Vector<Range> boundedCriterias)`

## Dependencies

- **sqlite-jdbc-3.50.3.0.jar:** SQLite Implementation of JDBC
- **json-20250517.jar:** To store sample data using JSON key-value pairs

- **jcalendar-1.4.jar:** UI for date picking (potentially)
- **flatlaf-3.6.2.jar:** Better Look-and-Feel

## Code Explanations

### ORM

I wrote a simple ORM using reflection and annotations. The structure is pretty straightforward:

```
orm
├── Constraints.java
├── DataMapper.java
├── Reflection.java
├── SQLiteQueryConstructor.java
└── Table.java
```

### Frontend structure

Swing only provides basic building blocks like scrollables panes and clickable buttons and is quite low-level. There's no built-in
`required` option to set on text fields or some semantic construct like an HTML `form`. All of this has to be handled by the
programmer.

The following structure reduces boilerplate and tries to separate concerns into classes with one and only one job while also
trying not to spiral and drown in abstraction. That's harder than it seems to an inexperienced programmer. There is a lot of
re-writting that happened and that's invisible in the final product.

**gui package**

```
gui
├── dashboard
│   ├── Dashboard.java
│   ├── Home.java
│   ├── record
│   │   ├── dialog
│   │   │   ├── ForeignPicker.java
│   │   │   ├── MultipleSelections.java
│   │   │   ├── RangeSelection.java
│   │   │   ├── RecordEditor.java
│   │   │   └── SearchProfile.java
│   │   ├── Record.java
│   │   ├── TableView.java
│   │   └── ToolBar.java
│   ├── Records.java
│   └── Sidebar.java
├── MainApp.java
├── Opts.java
└── SignIn.java
```

The idea is that 1 UI Entity = 1 class = 1 file. Since there's no tag-based language to represent swing components I thought i
would at least try to structure it to limit spagheti-like code but i wasn't really able to eliminate it.

**contract package**

```
contract
├── Listener.java
└── ToClear.java
```

Encapsulation using packages brought a problem of communication between components. The solution I found was using interfaces as
contracts to communicate between elements (log in, log out, clear event, selections, ...). This fixed the problem that happens
when separating a `SideBar` which naturally contains the buttons to navigate the dashboard. It only needs to fire a `HOME` event
by calling the function defined in the `Listener` interface to communicate with the main container to switch the main visible panel.

**utilitites**

```
component
├── Factory.java
├── MyButton.java
├── MyDialog.java
├── MyLabel.java
└── MyPanel.java
mapper
├── FieldEditorMapper.java
├── FieldLabelFormatter.java
└── FieldValueMapper.java
```

# OOP Lessons

## Code reusablility & API Design

- `util.CaseConverter` has a same implementation for pascal/camel case -> snake case (basically) and you also might want to use
those functions for multiple arguments or a single argument
> you separate between implementation detail and the exposed functions API (they should just be intuitive and makes sense
> semantically)

## Object-Oriented Separation of concerns

- `orm.SQLiteQueryConstructor` the `columns` and `tableName` field used to be defined in the enclosing class and populated in the `DataDefinition`
  which confused me when i re-read the code. The columns feild was then made to belong in the class that populated it. `tableName`
  was populated and defined in the enclosing class when really it really wasn't the right place to since then the `DataDefinition`
  assumed that it was already populated and thus a simple constructor re-ordering meant a really subtle bug.
